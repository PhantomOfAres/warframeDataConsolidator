# warframeDataConsolidator
Categorizes data from VoiDGlitch's data dumps into drop types.

To use, check out the script from the same root directory as https://github.com/VoiDGlitch/WarframeData. Then, simply run 'python consolidator.py'.
I would recommend piping the output into a file, but I've uploaded the current version in this repo.

Note: This script is rather hacky, and I'll clean it up at some point. I hope.
